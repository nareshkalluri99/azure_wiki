## 1. Ansible:


Ansible is an open source IT automation platform from Red Hat. It enables organizations to automate many IT processes usually performed manually, including provisioning, configuration management, application deployment and orchestration.

### Ansible Terms:

**Controller Machine:** The machine where Ansible is installed, responsible for running the provisioning on the servers you are managing.

**Inventory:** An initialization file that contains information about the servers you are managing.

**Playbook:** The entry point for Ansible provisioning, where the automation is defined through tasks using YAML format.

**Task:** A block that defines a single procedure to be executed, e.g. Install a package.

**Module:** A module typically abstracts a system task, like dealing with packages or creating and changing files. Ansible has a multitude of built-in modules, but you can also create custom ones.

**Role:** A pre-defined way for organizing playbooks and other files in order to facilitate sharing and reusing portions of a provisioning.

**Play:** A provisioning executed from start to finish is called a play. In simple words, execution of a playbook is called a play.

**Facts:** Global variables containing information about the system, like network interfaces or operating system.

**Handlers:** Used to trigger service status changes, like restarting or stopping a service.

### Advantages of Ansible: 

- Agent-less
- Simple
- Powerful & Flexible
- Efficient

## 2. Git: 

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

Git is used to tracking changes in the source code, enabling multiple developers to work together on non-linear development. Linus Torvalds created Git in 2005 for the development of the Linux kernel.

### Features of Git: 

- Tracks history
- Free and open source
- Supports non-linear development
- Creates backups
- Scalable
- Supports collaboration
- Branching is easier
- Distributed development
