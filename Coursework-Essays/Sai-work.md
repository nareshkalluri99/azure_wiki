**Ansible and Git:-**

Ansible automates repetitive processes that are carried out across several servers or devices, saving time and reducing errors. Git on the other hand, it is a distribute version control system that helps developer to track changes on their codebase over time. And also it allows teams to collaborate on code, revert changes, and maintain a complete history of their work.
