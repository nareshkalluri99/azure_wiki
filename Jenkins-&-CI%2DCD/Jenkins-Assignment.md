Proposed lab:

1. create new jobs in the respective views similar to what I created(venkat) and created with your name. use your branch with the docker file which you push into tour branch.
2. create a new job in ansible view to run the playbook which will create a user in jenkins host with your name. This should use your branch and then run the playbook from jenkins job.
