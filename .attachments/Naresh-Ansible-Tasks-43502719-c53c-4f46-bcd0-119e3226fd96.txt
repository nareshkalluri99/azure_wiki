Ansible Tasks

Steps:  

1.Installed Ansible by using the below commands

sudo yum install epel-release
sudo yum install ansible


2.By checking the Ansible version 

ansible --version


3.Done SSH : 

ssh-keygen 

By using this command i generated the id_rsa and id_rsa.pub key files.


4.Next I check the both machines ip's :

ip a s


5.Copied another machine ip : 

sudo ssh-copy-id 10.0.0.138


6.Tried whether ansible connection is working or not : 

ansible localhost -m ping -v


7.Tried connecting another machine: 

ssh naree@10.0.0.138
it gives me an error states that enable cockpit.socket
systemctl enable --now cockpit.socket
it asks the password of the another machine when you given the authentication completed.


8.if I see on the other machine after adding into known_hosts:

cd .ssh
ls -la
authorized_keys file created on the other machine.


9.Adding server on hosts file on master node: 

cd /etc/ansible
ls -la
vi hosts
added server on the hosts file.


10.Added playbooks.yml files: 

For example , vi playbook-install.yml , vi playbook-adduser.yml 


11.Run the playbooks: 

ansible-playbook playbook-install.yml 
ansible-playbook playbook-adduser.yml

12.After the Playbooks were succesfully executed, I went to the client node and verified that the softwares , file permissions or the executed task completed or not.
